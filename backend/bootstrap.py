"""
Optional startup auto-seed (Option 1, gated by SEED_ON_STARTUP).

When SEED_ON_STARTUP=true, the app self-seeds on boot so a FRESH deploy shows data
without a manual seed step. It is written to be SAFE to run on every boot:

  • Crew table (Postgres) — seeded ONLY when empty. scripts.seed_crew DROPS and
    recreates the table, so running it over existing rows would wipe runtime state
    (match scores, pool moves); the emptiness guard prevents that.
  • EntityMap (AGE)       — rebuilt every boot when AGE is on. Idempotent (all MERGE),
    derived from the crew table, so it must run AFTER the crew seed.
  • OrgMap (AGE)          — rebuilt every boot when AGE is on. Idempotent (all MERGE);
    overlays EntityMap's Vessel/Crew nodes, so it must run AFTER EntityMap.

OpsMap needs nothing here — it mines itself from the live workflow event log.

Every step is wrapped so a failure is logged and the app still boots. Default OFF —
this is a demo / fresh-deploy convenience, not a steady-state production path.
